# TrollStore

TrollStore in a permasigned jailed app that can permanently install any IPA you open in it.

A proper readme will be added shortly, for now see the release post on reddit.

The CoreTrust bug only affects 14.0 - 15.5b4, TrollStore will most likely never support any versions outside that range.

15.2 and up are unsupported currently as there is no way to install TrollStore to these versions until the install method of Fugu15 is public.
